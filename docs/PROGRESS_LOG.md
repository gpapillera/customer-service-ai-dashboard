## [Bugfix] Icons, blank forms, sidenav layout, design system — 2026-07-11
**Status:** Complete (verified in browser, not just "no console errors")
**Root causes found & fixed:**
1. **Icons broken everywhere.** `index.html` had NO Material Icons `<link>`, and `mat-icon` was used in ~8 templates, so the ligature text (`arrow_back`, `add`, `auto_awesome`…) rendered as raw truncated glyphs. Replaced the CDN-dependent `mat-icon` with a local, bundled solution: installed `lucide-angular@^1.0.0` (npm dep, no runtime CDN) and added `shared/cs-icon.component.ts` (`<cs-icon name="...">`) that maps the old Material names → Lucide SVGs. Swapped all `<mat-icon>` usages project-wide (layout, dashboard, customer/case list/detail/form) and imported `CsIconComponent` into each host component. Centralized mapping means it can't silently break again.
2. **New customer / New case pages blank.** Both form templates used `class="form-card reveal" appReveal`, but `RevealDirective` was NOT imported in either form component — so `.reveal { opacity:0 }` was never cleared and the card stayed invisible. Added `RevealDirective` to `customer-form.component.ts` and `case-form.component.ts` imports. (Edit variants share these components, so they're fixed too.)
3. **User menu floating / overlapping content.** The user block lived in a top `mat-toolbar`, not the sidenav. Rebuilt `layout.component.html` so the sidenav is a flex column: brand + nav at top, user menu (`account_circle` / name / role / Sign out) anchored at the bottom via `justify-content: space-between` + a top-border divider. Sidenav is now `height:100vh` and never overlaps `router-outlet`.
4. **Apple-like design system not visible.** `styles.scss` tokens (`.cs-lift`, `--cs-accent`, etc.) were defined but the earlier bugs hid content. Verified in DevTools: `--cs-accent:#0071e3` and `--cs-radius:18px` on `:root`; `.cs-lift` elements carry the soft shadow `0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,.06)` and the `cubic-bezier(0.22,1,0.36,1)` transition. Fixed a real conflict: `.reveal.is-visible { transform: translateY(0) }` was overriding `.cs-lift:hover`, cancelling the hover lift — bumped hover specificity (`.cs-lift.reveal:hover`) so cards now rise 3px on hover (confirmed `matrix(1,0,0,1,0,-3)` at hover).
**Files added / changed:**
- frontend/package.json (added `lucide-angular`)
- frontend/src/app/shared/cs-icon.component.ts (NEW)
- frontend/src/app/shared/layout/layout.component.{html,scss,ts}
- frontend/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.html + .ts
- frontend/src/app/customers/*.{list,detail,form}.component.{html,ts}
- frontend/src/app/cases/*.{list,detail,form}.component.{html,ts}
- frontend/src/styles.scss (hover-lift specificity fix)
**Browser verification (what I literally saw):**
- Logged in as `admin` at http://localhost:4200. Sidebar nav, user avatar, and all buttons now show real SVG icons (rendered as `<img>`), not text.
- `/customers/new`: full form renders (Full name, Email, Phone, Company, Address + Cancel/Create). Filled it, clicked **Create customer**, landed on `/customers` and the new "Test User" row appears in the list.
- `/cases/new`: full form renders (Subject, Description, Customer + Category selects, AI toggle, Cancel/Create).
- `/customers/1/edit`: form loads with pre-populated data (Juan Dela Cruz, juan@acme.ph, …) and a "Save changes" button.
- Sidenav: brand + nav at top, "Ada Admin / Admin / Sign out" docked at the bottom, dashboard content in the main area with no overlap.
- Hovering a KPI card lifts it 3px (transform confirmed). No console errors except a benign `NG0912` Lucide component-ID collision warning (library-internal, harmless).
**Known issues / TODO:**
- `NG0912` warning: Lucide's `LucideAngularComponent` generates a duplicate component ID when `LucideAngularModule` is pulled in via the standalone `CsIconComponent`. Cosmetic only; no functional impact. Could be silenced later by importing the icon component differently if it becomes noisy.
- No automated frontend tests yet.

## [Phase 9] Dashboard with live charts (KPIs + line/bar) — 2026-07-11
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- `dashboard/dashboard.component.*` rewritten from placeholder into a real dashboard:
  - 4 KPI cards (Total cases, Open cases, High priority, Customers) with icons + subtle lift/scale hover.
  - Line chart "Cases created (last 30 days)" (`trend` from `DashboardSummary`) with area fill.
  - Bar chart "Cases by category" (`byCategory` from `DashboardSummary`).
  - Loading spinner + empty/error states; data via `DashboardService.get()`.
- `main.ts`: registers the Chart.js pieces the app uses (`CategoryScale`, `LinearScale`, `PointElement`, `LineElement`, `BarElement`, `LineController`, `BarController`, `Tooltip`, `Legend`, `Title`, `Filler`) so ng2-charts renders without "not a registered scale" / "Filler plugin" errors.
- `styles.scss` + `shared/reveal.directive.ts`: Apple-like design system (system font stack, `#f5f5f7` bg, white surfaces, `#0071e3` accent, 18px radii, soft shadows, `cubic-bezier(0.22,1,0.36,1)` easing) with `.reveal`/`.cs-lift`/`.stagger` animation utilities and `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
**Files added / changed:**
- frontend/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.{ts,html,scss}
- frontend/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.service.ts
- frontend/src/main.ts (Chart.js registration)
- frontend/src/styles.scss (Apple-like theme + animation utilities)
- frontend/src/app/shared/reveal.directive.ts (scroll-reveal IntersectionObserver directive)
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- Charts use `ChartConfiguration<'line'>` / `<'bar'>` with a shared `baseOptions()` typed as `ChartOptions` and cast at call sites (avoids Angular generic mismatch).
- Design language intentionally simple/Apple-like per user request: subtle hover lift + scroll reveal only, no heavy motion.
**Validation:** `ng build` clean. Browser: login → dashboard shows 4 KPI cards (7 total / 6 open / 3 high / 4 customers) and both canvases render with live data; no console errors.
**Known issues / TODO:**
- No automated frontend tests yet (Phase 11).
**Next step:** Phase 10/11 — search & filter polish, then tests.

## [Phase 8] Customer & Case UI (list, detail, create/edit, call-log) — 2026-07-11
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- **Customers:** `customer.service.ts` (list/search/get/create/update/delete → `/api/customers`), `customer-list.component.*` (debounced search, grid of cards, per-card menu), `customer-form.component.*` (create/edit reactive form), `customer-detail.component.*` (read view).
- **Cases:** `case.service.ts` (list with status/priority/category filters + search, get/create/update/delete → `/api/cases`), `case-list.component.*` (filter bar + search + cards showing status/priority + AI badge), `case-form.component.*` (create/edit with "Let AI suggest priority" slide-toggle on create), `case-detail.component.*` (case info + AI badge + call-log form), `call-log.service.ts` (list by case + create → `/api/calllogs`).
- `shared/categories.ts`: `CATEGORIES` constant (ids 1–5 matching seed: Billing, Shipping / Supply Chain, Technical Support, Account, Product Quality) + `categoryName()` helper — used because there is **no `/api/categories` endpoint**; the backend returns `categoryId`/`categoryName` on cases and the frontend keeps the id↔name map locally.
- `app.routes.ts`: added child routes `customers` (list/new/:id/:id/edit) and `cases` (list/new/:id/:id/edit) under the guarded shell.
**Files added / changed:**
- frontend/src/app/customers/* (service, list, form, detail)
- frontend/src/app/cases/* (service, list, form, detail, call-log.service)
- frontend/src/app/shared/categories.ts, shared/models.ts (updated to match actual DTOs)
- frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- `Case.status`/`Case.priority` are strings (`'Open'|'InProgress'|...`, `'Low'|'Medium'|'High'`) — required the backend to serialize enums as strings (see Phase 8 backend note below).
- AI priority toggle on case create calls `POST /api/cases` without an explicit priority; backend `CaseService` runs the ONNX predictor and sets `PriorityAutoSuggested=true`.
**Backend change (required for frontend):** `Program.cs` now adds `JsonStringEnumConverter` to `AddControllers()` so `CaseStatus`/`Priority` enums serialize as strings (frontend previously crashed with `status.toLowerCase is not a function` when it received numbers).
**Validation:** `ng build` clean. Browser end-to-end verified:
- Customers: list (4 seeded) + search filter; create "Test User" → appears in list; search finds it.
- Cases: list with status/priority/category filters + search; create case with AI toggle → detail shows **High / AI suggested** (correct for "urgent replacement needed"); add call log → appears in the log list.
- Case detail deep-links to customer; edit links work.
**Known issues / TODO:**
- No `/api/categories` endpoint — categories are a frontend constant; if seed categories change, update `shared/categories.ts`.
- No automated frontend tests yet (Phase 11).
**Next step:** Phase 9 — real dashboard with charts (done immediately after).

## [Phase 7] Frontend scaffolding (Angular shell, routing, Auth, interceptor) — 2026-07-11
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- Angular 18 standalone workspace scaffolded directly in `/frontend` (flattened from the `ng new` subfolder). Angular CLI installed locally as a dev dependency (`@angular/cli@18`); Material 18 + CDK + `ng2-charts@6` + `chart.js@4` added.
- `app.config.ts`: providers for router (in-memory scroll), `HttpClient` (DI interceptors), and animations.
- `auth/auth.service.ts`: login + JWT stored in `sessionStorage`, `BehaviorSubject` + signal for current user, `isAuthenticated()`/`getRole()`/`logout()`.
- `auth/token.interceptor.ts` + `HTTP_INTERCEPTORS` provider: attaches `Bearer` token to every request.
- `auth/auth.guard.ts`: `CanActivateFn` redirecting unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- `auth/login/login.component.*`: reactive form (username/password), Material card, inline validation, loading spinner, error banner.
- `shared/layout/layout.component.*`: Material sidenav shell (toolbar with user menu + logout, nav list Dashboard/Customers/Cases) wrapping a `<router-outlet>`.
- `shared/models.ts`: TypeScript interfaces mirroring backend DTOs (LoginRequest/Response, Customer, Case, CallLog, Category, PagedResult, DashboardSummary, TrendPoint, CategoryBreakdown).
- `dashboard/dashboard.component.ts`: routed placeholder (full KPIs/charts in Phase 9).
- `app.routes.ts`: `/login` (public) + guarded shell with `/dashboard` (default redirect) and `**` → dashboard.
- `proxy.conf.json` + `angular.json` serve target: dev proxy `/api` → `http://localhost:5274` (matches backend CORS origin `localhost:4200`).
- `styles.scss`: Angular Material M3 theme (`mat.define-theme` + `all-component-themes` wrapped in `html`), indigo/teal palette.
**Files added / changed:**
- frontend/ (new Angular app: src/app/**, angular.json, proxy.conf.json, package.json, etc.)
- frontend/src/app/app.config.ts, app.routes.ts, app.component.html (replaced default welcome)
- frontend/src/app/auth/*, shared/models.ts, shared/layout/*, dashboard/*
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- Standalone components (Angular 18 default) — no NgModule.
- JWT in `sessionStorage` for MVP simplicity (noted as less secure than httpOnly cookie in code comments + README TODO).
- Material 18.2 uses the M3 `define-theme` API; `all-component-themes` must be wrapped in a selector (`html`).
- Bumped `angular.json` initial bundle budget to 1MB (Material pushes past the 500kB default) — dev only.
**Validation:** `ng build` succeeds; ran backend (:5274) + frontend (:4200); confirmed via browser that login (`admin`/`Passw0rd!`) stores JWT, redirects to `/dashboard`, and the guarded layout (toolbar + sidenav) renders. Proxy `/api` → backend verified with curl.
**Known issues / TODO:**
- Customers/Cases routes exist in the nav but have no components yet (Phase 8).
- No automated frontend tests yet (Phase 11).
**Next step:** Phase 8 — Customer & Case UI (list, detail, create/edit forms, call-log form).

## [Phase 5] ML model — synthetic data, train, ONNX export — 2026-07-11
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- `ml/train_model.py`: generates a synthetic, rule-labeled dataset (`generate_synthetic_data`, 3,000 rows, ~8% label noise), trains a `DecisionTreeClassifier` (max_depth=6, min_samples_leaf=20), evaluates (accuracy + confusion matrix), and exports to `ml/models/priority_model.onnx` (opset 17).
- Model input is the 4-feature float vector the backend expects: `[categoryId, priorCaseCount, daysSinceLastContact, hasComplaintKeyword]`, named `input`. Output `probabilities` is float[3] in **[Low, Medium, High]** order — matches `OnnxPriorityPredictor._labels`.
- `docs/MODEL_CARD.md` written: intended use, features, training-data limitations (synthetic), evaluation (test acc 0.93; 98.8% rule agreement on a feature grid), reproduce/retrain steps, ethical notes.
- Backend `OnnxPriorityPredictor` hardened to select the `probabilities` output by name (the model now also emits a string `label` output), so it won't crash on the new export.
**Files added / changed:**
- ml/train_model.py (new)
- ml/requirements.txt — pinned onnx==1.22.0, skl2onnx==1.20.0 (latest combo that exports TreeEnsembleClassifier cleanly)
- ml/models/priority_model.onnx (generated; gitignored)
- docs/MODEL_CARD.md (new)
- backend/src/CustomerService.ML/OnnxPriorityPredictor.cs — robust output selection
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- Integer labels 0/1/2 = Low/Medium/High so the ONNX probability order is deterministic and matches the backend (string labels sorted alphabetically and broke ordering).
- Exported at opset 17 because onnxruntime 1.18.1 (backend) only guarantees support through opset 21; opset 22 failed to load.
- Python deps installed into a local `ml/.venv` (system Python is externally-managed / no pip); `python3-venv` had to be apt-installed first.
**Known issues / TODO:**
- Training data is synthetic — retrain on real historical cases before any production use (documented in MODEL_CARD.md).
- `Low` recall is modest (~0.65) due to class rarity in synthetic data; acceptable for a suggestion aid.
**Next step:** Phase 7 — Angular frontend scaffolding (shell, routing, Auth module, JWT interceptor).

## [Phase 4] Data cleaning script (`ml/clean_data.py`) — 2026-07-11
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- Rewrote `ml/clean_data.py` to fully comply with build-prompt Section 9. Pipeline: (1) drop exact duplicates, (2) normalize phones to digits, (3) lowercase/trim emails, (4) parse messy dates → ISO 8601, (5) fill missing Category with `"Uncategorized"`, (6) trim all text, (7) **flag** rows missing required fields (Customer Name, Case Subject) into `ml/data/cleaned/rejected_rows.csv` instead of dropping, (8) write cleaned output to `ml/data/cleaned/cases_cleaned.csv` and print a summary (rows in / out / rejected).
- Reads the canonical raw schema: `Customer Name, Email, Phone, Case Subject, Description, Category, Date Created, Status` (case-insensitive column matching).
- Updated sample `ml/data/raw_cases.csv` to the new schema, including edge cases (duplicate, missing name, missing subject, missing category, missing date).
**Files added / changed:**
- ml/clean_data.py (rewritten)
- ml/data/raw_cases.csv (new schema + edge cases)
- ml/data/cleaned/cases_cleaned.csv, ml/data/cleaned/rejected_rows.csv (generated)
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- Category vocabulary aligned to the backend seed categories (Billing, Shipping / Supply Chain, Technical Support, Account, Product Quality, General Inquiry) plus `Uncategorized` fallback.
- Dedup compares **parsed** dates so `2024/01/05` and `2024-01-05` collapse as duplicates.
**Validation:** `python ml/clean_data.py` on the 11-row sample → 10 unique, 7 cleaned, 3 rejected (missing name/subject). Works as specified.
**Next step:** Phase 5 — ML model training (done immediately after).

## [Phase 3] Backend API (layered, JWT, CRUD, Dashboard, Swagger) — 2026-07-10
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- ASP.NET Core 8 Web API with layered architecture: Controllers -> Services (Application) -> Repositories (Infrastructure) -> EF Core (Domain entities).
- JWT auth (HS256) with Admin/Agent roles; `AuthController.Login` issues tokens with name/role claims.
- CRUD endpoints: Customers (list/detail/search/create/update/delete), Cases (list+filters/create/update/delete), CallLogs (by-case/create), Dashboard (KPI + trend + category breakdown).
- Swagger/OpenAPI enabled with JWT bearer security; CORS policy for Angular dev server (localhost:4200).
- ML priority auto-suggestion wired into `POST /api/cases` (Phase 6 work done early — see below).
- XML doc comments on all public classes/methods.
**Files added / changed:**
- backend/src/CustomerService.{Api,Application,Infrastructure,Domain,ML}/** — full project set
- backend/src/CustomerService.Api/Program.cs — composition root + HTTP pipeline
- backend/src/CustomerService.Api/Controllers/*Controller.cs — Auth, Customers, Cases, CallLogs, Dashboard
- backend/src/CustomerService.Application/Services/*Service.cs — business logic
- backend/src/CustomerService.Infrastructure/Data/* — AppDbContext, repositories, seed data
- backend/src/CustomerService.ML/* — OnnxPriorityPredictor + RuleBasedPriorityPredictor
- backend/src/CustomerService.Api/appsettings.json (+ .Development.json)
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- Project references arranged to avoid cycles: Api -> {Application, Infrastructure, ML}; Application -> {Domain, ML, Infrastructure}; ML -> Domain; Infrastructure -> {Domain, Application}. `IPriorityPredictor`/`PriorityFeatures` live in Domain (shared contract).
- SQL Server is the production provider (per spec). Added a **SQLite fallback** via `Database:Provider` config so the app runs locally without SQL Server. Default is SqlServer.
- Seed data uses navigation properties (no explicit identity IDs) to avoid "insert explicit value into identity column" errors.
- Demo credentials: admin/Passw0rd!, agent/Passw0rd!, maria/Passw0rd! (BCrypt-hashed at seed time).
**Known issues / TODO:**
- `dotnet run` first-start is slow (~40s) because `EnsureCreated` + seed runs many queries; switch to EF migrations for production.
- JWT key is a dev placeholder in appsettings; must be externalized for prod.
- No automated tests yet (Phase 9 pending).
**Next step:** Phase 4 — write ml/clean_data.py (CSV cleaning/normalization).

## [Phase 2] Database schema + EF Core + seed — 2026-07-10
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- Five entities mapped in EF Core: User, Customer, Category, Case, CallLog (relationships, unique indexes on UserName/Category.Name, cascade deletes).
- `AppDbContext` with fluent config; `AppDbContextFactory` for design-time EF tools.
- Idempotent seeder (`SeedDataInitializer`) inserting categories, users (BCrypt), customers, cases, call logs.
- SQL Server 2022 Developer installed natively on Zorin OS 18.1 (Ubuntu 24.04) via `database/install_sqlserver.sh`; DB `CustomerServiceDb` + login `csadmin` created.
**Files added / changed:**
- backend/src/CustomerService.Infrastructure/Data/AppDbContext.cs, AppDbContextFactory.cs, SeedData.cs, SeedDataInitializer.cs, Repository.cs, DashboardRepository.cs
- backend/src/CustomerService.Domain/Entities/*.cs — entity + enum definitions
- database/install_sqlserver.sh — reproducible SQL Server install (jammy repo + libldap deb + data dir on external drive)
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- SQL Server data files redirected to `/media/ebnzr/SSDrive_500GB/sqlserver-data` (ASCII path) because `mssql-conf` rejects the emoji-named project folder path.
- `mssql-server` is only in the `mssql-server-2022` jammy repo; `mssql-tools18` is in the `prod` jammy repo (script adds both).
- Login password `P@ssw0rd_2024_Xq` chosen to satisfy SQL Server password policy (must not contain login name).
**Known issues / TODO:**
- EF migrations not yet generated (using `EnsureCreated`); add `dotnet ef migrations add Initial` for prod parity.
**Next step:** Phase 3 — build the backend API (done immediately after).

## [Phase 1] Scaffold repo structure — 2026-07-10
**Status:** Complete
**What was built:**
- Repo folders: /backend, /frontend, /ml, /database, /docs.
- .NET 8 solution `CustomerServiceApi.sln` with projects: Api (web), Application, Infrastructure, Domain, ML, Tests (xUnit).
- Verified toolchains: dotnet 8.0.407, node v24.18.0, npm 11.16.0, Angular CLI, Python 3.12.3, git 2.43.0. SQL Server installed (see Phase 2).
**Files added / changed:**
- backend/CustomerServiceApi.sln + 6 projects
- docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md (this file)
**Decisions & assumptions made:**
- No MVP_BUILD_PROMPT.md SQL DDL was present, so the schema was designed from the described entities (Users, Customers, Categories, Cases, CallLogs) — documented in Phase 2.
- Angular frontend will be created in /frontend as a standalone workspace (Phase 7).
**Known issues / TODO:**
- None.
**Next step:** Phase 2 — SQL Server schema + EF Core + seed (done immediately after).
